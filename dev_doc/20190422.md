## key

gimbal pos estimation is done by PNP, which may not need imu info from board.

the key function is in file: /home/neranger/rm2019_ws/src/RM2019-Artinx-Guardian-ROS/roborts_detection/armor_detection/armor_detection_node.cpp

function: void ArmorDetectionNode::ExecuteLoop()

```cpp
if(detected_enemy_) {
        float pitch, yaw;
        gimbal_control_.Transform(target_3d, pitch, yaw);

        gimbal_angle_.yaw_mode = true;
        gimbal_angle_.pitch_mode = false;
        gimbal_angle_.yaw_angle = yaw * 0.7;
        gimbal_angle_.pitch_angle = pitch;

        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> guard(mutex_);
        undetected_count_ = undetected_armor_delay_;
        PublishMsgs();
      } 
```

## problem

yaw and pitch seem to be in the coordinate for camera, which may require handler at board
